<li> Compilers/interpreters are often divided into three phases: tokeniztion, parsing, and interpretation.   Briefly describe the main "job" of each of these phases, in terms of its "input" and "output.

```java
public String speak(Animal a) {
  if (a instanceof Dog) {
    return "Bark!";
  } else if (a instanceof Cat) {
    return "Meow";

(10 pts) The phrase *code smell* is used by some software developers to refer to things in "other people's code" that suggest that the code may have some problems, and needs to be refactored.

Long sequences of if/else statements that use `instanceof` are often considered to be a so-called *code smell*.   For example, the code in the box at right.

Please give at least two reasons that this style of code is not desirable, as compared to some of the available alternatives.

For each of the ASTs shown below (a, b, and c), give an arithmetic expression that would result in this tree.  Parentheses may be used.  Note that there may be more than one correct answer.

(10 pts) In your own words, how does an AST capture the idea of operator precedence?

(20 pts) One of the main ideas in the [visitor pattern tutorial](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-F16/visitor-pattern-tutorial) is the difference between single dispatch and double dispatch.  Suppose you were interviewing at some company (say, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft) and you got a head's up from an alum that "single vs. double dispatch" is one of the interview questions they ask to see if people "know their stuff".      What concise, but precise answer would you rehearse so that the interviewer would know you understand the difference?

</li>



<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:9em;">

(20 pts) Why, according to the tutorial, is the visitor pattern may be
a good fit for a compiler/interpreter?  In your answer, be sure to
specify: what object is being "visited" in a compiler/interpreter.
