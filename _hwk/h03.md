(10 pts)  Based on your reading in <span data-hfj="7" />:

What does it mean to have a "polymorphic argument" or a "polymorphic
return type" for a method?  Explain with an example&mdash;but NOT
using the example of Vets and Animals used in the book.  Substitute
your own example.  Give a detailed enough description of the class
hierarchy you have in mind to make it clear that you get the concept.

<h3 style="text-align:center;">Java code examples</h3>

Several questions on this page ask you to illustrate your answers with Java code excerpts.

Your examples do not need to be a "complete" Java classes.  They can be partial Java classes
with with some ellipsis (...) to show parts you are leaving out.  It needs to
   have just enough detail to illustrate the point you are making. For example the following
   Java code might be used to illustrate various things (what those are is left for you to
   figure out.)

```java
public class Bar { ... }
public class Baz { ... }
public class Foo extends Bar {
  private Baz thingy;
  ...
}
```

(10 pts) What is one advantage of using an `ArrayList` over a plain old Java array (e.g.&nbsp;`ArrayList<Integer> nums;` vs. `int [] nums;`)?

Two terms that are very important, and commonly confused are *overloading* vs. *overriding*. 
There is a passage in <span data-hfj="7"></span> that helps to explain the difference.

<ol>
 <li style="margin-bottom: 10em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) Explain what overloading is, with a specific example
 of Java code.

 Java code.

There is a passage in <span data-hfj="7"></span> that helps to explain the difference between IS-A and HAS-A:



<ol>
 <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;" markdown="1"> (5 pts) Which one corresponds to *composition*?
 </li>
 <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;" markdown="1"> (5 pts) Which one corresponds to *inheritance*?
 </li>
 <li style="margin-bottom: 10em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) Explain (with some Java code) an example of
   two classes that have a HAS-A relationship.

<li  markdown="1">
(10 pts) Why do some classes in the Java API have package names that start with `java.blah` while others have package names that start with `javax.blah`?  What does the `x` mean?
