*Reading Assignment:* 

* Read <span data-hfj="9">HFJ 9</span>, <span data-hfj="10">HFJ 10</span>, and <span data-hfj="11">HFJ 11</span> along with the online reading notes that go with those chapters. Then, do the problems below.   Refer back to previous chapters as needed.

Be sure you understand <em>precisely</em> the difference between auto boxing and auto unboxing before answering the following questions.

<li style="margin-bottom:5em;" markdown="1"> 

(10 pts) Write a line (or two) of Java code that would result in auto-unboxing but NOT auto-boxing

<li markdown="1">  From <span data-hfj="11"></span>: Exceptions in Java can be divided into two broad categories:

* One category is the kind that, if there is any chance it can happen in the code has to be "caught or declared to be thrown" 
* The other category is the kind that can happen, but doesn't have to be "caught or declared to be thrown".

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> 

(10 pts) Exceptions that  do not have to be caught or declared to be thrown are extensions of (i.e. they are subclasses of) what 
class?

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> 
(10 pts) What is the rationale  for having some exceptions that do NOT have to be declared to be thrown or caught? (i.e. why did the designers of Java put that feature into the language?)

<li style="margin-bottom:18em;" markdown="1"> 

(20 pts) From <span data-hfj="11"></span>: Assume that s is an object of type <code>Student</code>, and that there is a method 
`public void registerFor(String courseNum)` that might throw the `NoSuchUCSBCourseException`. 

Write a segment of Java code that will:
* call `s.registerFor(someCourse);`
* write `"Success"` on `System.out` if the registration succeeded (i.e. that exception doesn't happen)
* write `"Sorry " + someCourse + "does not exist"` to `System.out` if that exception occurs.

<div style="font-family: Arial Narrow, sans-serif; font-size: 90%;" markdown="1">
*Hint*: this question is designed to see if you understand how to use `try`/`catch`.   On an exam, you would not get this hint.

<li style="margin-bottom:1em;" markdown="1"> 
(10 pts) From <span data-hfj="11"></span>: Write the code that creates a new kind of exception called <code>BadSuitException</code>.  This exception might be thrown, for example, by a program that expects a character that is one of 'H','D','C','S' for Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs and Spades when it encounters an illegal value (one other than 'H', 'D','C' or 'S'.)   <code>BadSuitException</code> should be a subclass of <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>.   Write ONLY the code that creates the new kind of exception. 

<div style="font-family: Arial Narrow, sans-serif; font-size: 90%;" markdown="1">
*Hint:* If you do this properly, it should be *very* short.   The best answer is a single line.  There are also answers that are two lines, or at most five.   If you write more than five lines, you are likely on the wrong track.   On an exam, you would not get this hint.
